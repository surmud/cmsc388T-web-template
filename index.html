      <img class="about-prof-image" src="/assets/profile_pic.jpg" height="200" width="200">
      <p> My name is Surmud Jamil and I'm a senior at the University of Maryland, where I'm majoring in computer science. This website is a project for CMSC388T, where I'm learning how to deploy a website on our school's server, terpconnect. Some classes that I've loved are CMSC320: Data Science, CMSC436: IOS Development, and CMSC422: Machine learning.

      <p>
        Besides my classes at UMD, I've had the chance to work as a Peer Advisor for our CS department, which has been a great experience. I'm also a TA 
        for CMSC320: Intro to data science, and last fall I was a TA for CMSC216: Introduction to computer systems. 
        Last summer I also had the opportunity to intern at Pearson as a software engineering intern. At Pearson, I learned a lot about agile, a methodolgy for developing software, and I had the chance to work on a great project and present it at the end of my internship.
      
        Some of my interests outside of school are football, basketball, chess, reading, sleeping, and more.

      <h2 class="section-header">Projects</h2>
      <p>Below are some projects that I've worked on:</p>
      <p><h3>Jupiter: UMD Schedule Builder</h3>

        Jupiter is a schedule builder for UMD students that intelligently generates and ranks potential schedules based on professor ratings and average GPA, while also removing duplicates, and ensuring that there are no time conflicts. Our application was developed specifically for a mobile device because it allows Apple Calendar synchronization, which means that the Jupiter will automatically sync a potential schedule with the userâ€™s iPhone calendar. Once the user syncs a schedule, their calendar will have recurring meetings set up every single day for each course they selected at their proper time until the end of the semester.

        <h3>NBA Hall of Fame Predictor</h3>
        
        My friends and I used basketball statistics to predict NBA Hall of Famers with 85% accuracy. Are hall of famers more physical than today's players? Do today's players shoot more? We answer these questions in our jupyter notebook. To do this project, we needed to parse, scrape, and clean NBA basketball data from several different sources to be able to conduct our analysis.

        <h3>Rate My UMD Landlord</h3>
        
        Ever had a terrible landlord? This is your chance to vent. This is a web application that I was able to develop using the flask framework in python. It allows users to register, log in, and post reviews and ratings of their landlord. This application was deployed to the Heroku cloud platform as the final project of my python development class. We never really advertised this application, which is why there are only fake reviews posted on the site currently. In this project we needed to create both a front end and a backend for our flask application. Our application's data is stored in a MongoDB cloud database.

        <h3>Eigenface Recognition</h3>
      
        In this project, my teammate and I implemented principal component analysis, which is a dimensionality reduction technique used in machine learning, to recognize images of faces with over 85% accuracy. We followed a case study based on an academic paper written by Turk and Pentland at https://www.face-rec.org/algorithms/PCA/jcn.pdf. This project was very math-heavy and required us to implement a lot of linear algebra in python, but we were able to gain a lot of valuable experience with the numpy library by doing this.
